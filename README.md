# Analysis of Energy Resources
Energy is the power or capacity to do work.
Electric Energy is caused by the movement of electric charges called electrons.
The energy resources fall into two main categories, often called renewable and non-renewable energy resources
We intend to do a deep analysis of how are we performing in minimizing our usage of non-renewable energy v/s to increased usage and popularity of renewable energy. We later on delve deep into one single region and show(through visualizations) the prospect places to harness renewable energy.

# Hypothesis 1
We anticipate that all countries or regions will reduce their non-renewable energy use. We'd also like to look at the use of non-renewableÂ vs. renewable energy.

# Hypothesis 2
As the state conflicts increase, we expect the prices of energy resources to increase.

While analyzing the data for hypothesis 1 we stumbled on statewide data for the USA. The dataset coincides with Biden's commitment to reduce the US emissions by 2030 and we decided to delve deeper in this and made an extension in the Hypothesis 1.

# Conclusions
## Hypothesis 1
Inconclusive, since there is a negative trend for all the non-renewable energies as expected but a sudden rise in natural gas.

## Hypothesis 2
The linear graph is slightly affected by the number of conflicts per year but need more data. the data for comparison is 1983-2020. To conclude if the oil prices is affected we need a larger test data.
